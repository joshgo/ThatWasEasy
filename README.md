# ThatWasEasy
Your very own easy button right at your desktop ... "That was easy!"

What's the purpose of the easy button? Absolutely nothing productive. It's just a fun way to celebrate completed tasks, that were far far easier than you originally thought. My coworkers were very quick to hit the button whenever I asked something silly.

Classic example of when to use the easy button:

    Joe: Hey Bob, how do I build the project?
    Bob: Just type 'build'
    Joe: Oh, thanks! How do I run it?    
    Bob: Just type 'run'
    Joe: Oh ... 
    Bob: (Click the button...."that was easy")
